# Simple Chat

This is a simple chat application that I developed while exploring the concepts of the WebSocket proctocol.

There aren't much features as the main purpose of this project was to learn the basic fundamentals of the websocket proctocol
and how it could be used in real life applications.

#### Packages used

- socket.io
- React
- Chakra UI
